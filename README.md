## way station

This repository was made as a holder for my university, home, test and pet projects of low significance for anyone other than myself.

Below is a brief description of each.

### Compiler

-

It's a university task of making simple C language compiler.

This one isn't finished and performs only lexical analysis.

### cppreflection

-

My first attempt at making some elements of introspection available in C++.
Approach taken here and attempt by itself were considered a failure.

### cppreflection2nd

-

Once again I tried to invent (And yes, I did reseach on the subject. There are some quite nice solutions such as clReflect) elements of introspection to C++.

This one is heavily based on preprocessor. Each reflected class gets code generated for accompanying metaclass.

It's also not finished yet, but I took this approach and continue to develop it inside deku2d-engine pet project.
